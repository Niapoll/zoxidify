# üßê Zoxidify

Enable the use of [**Zoxide**](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) to quickly navigate to frequently used paths in the terminal, with support for opening directories in your favorite editors.

## Add Your Own Editors

By default, **Zoxidify** uses the built-in editors specified in `ZOXIDIFY_DEFAULT_EDITORS`. You can override this with your own editors by defining `ZOXIDIFY_EDITORS` in your ZSH configuration file.
